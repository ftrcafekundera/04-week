# 04-week: Web APIs: Code Quiz

# Description / Motivation

This was a project to create a quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can guage my progress compared to my peers. This quiz was designed so that when a testee clicks the start button, they are presented with a question. When a question is answered, the testee is presented with the subsequent question until there are no further questions to be answered. If a testee answers a question incorrectly, 10 seconds will be removed from the timer as a penalty.

When all of the questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over. When the game is over, the testee can save their initials and score in the leaderboard.

This application runs in the browswer, and it features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

# Usage

**OLD** When you arrive at the webpage, you will first need to click on the "Generate Password" button to initiate a sequence of questions pertaining to the desired criteria of the password. The first prompt will ask you for the amount of characters you would like the password to contain; this number must be no less than 8 and no more than 128. 

Subsequently, you will be asked if you would like for the password to contain numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and/or special characters. After you have completed all of the questions, your randomized password will appear in the box that says "Your Secure Password."

Example of a generated password:
